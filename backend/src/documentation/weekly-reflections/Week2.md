# Week 2: Reflections
- **Week Range:** 09.12.24 - 15.12.24
- **Note:** I initially started working with my previous group and completed several tasks related to the FoodFinder App. However, due to challenges related to group dynamics, I made the decision to transition to an individual project in the following weeks to ensure steady progress and deliver a fully functional project within the limited time frame.

### Reflections to Include:
1. **Completed tasks**
   - Set up for PostgreSQL database by creating tables with their details: recipes, categories, recipe_categories,
   - Created the recipe router and the categories router in the backend folder,
   - Added a code block which functions as an example for how to create recipes in recipes.router.ts,
   - Ensured the database queries (e.g., filtering recipes by category) work as intended,
   - Wrote SQL scripts to populate tables with initial data,
   - Created tables: recipes, categories, recipe_categories,
   - Created example code blocks for each CRUD operation in both recipes.router.ts and categories.router.ts,
   - Defined primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints

2. **Challenges**
   - **Database Setup Complexity:** Setting up relationships and constraints between tables (e.g., recipes, categories, and recipe_categories) required careful consideration to ensure data integrity and query efficiency.
   - **Group Dynamics:** Because of the challenges stemming from group dynamics, including misaligned communication, lack of commitment and uneven task distribution, I transitioned to an individual project to take full control of the development process and ensure the delivery of a fully functional project within the limited time frame.

3. **Learning insights**
   - **Database Design:** Learned how to effectively define and implement primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for relational databases in PostgreSQL.
   - **Backend Development:** Gained insights into writing clean and reusable code for CRUD operations in backend routers
   - **Collaboration Challenges:** Understood the importance of management, shared commitment, clear communication and aligned expectations in group projects to avoid mismanagement.

4. **Personal contributions**
   - Created PostgreSQL database design, including defining tables and relationships.
   - Wrote SQL scripts for populating initial data and tested queries to ensure functionality.
   - Developed backend routers and example code blocks for CRUD operations.
