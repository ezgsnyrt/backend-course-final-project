# Week 2: Reflections
- **Week Range:** 09.12.24 - 15.12.24
- **Note:** This week, I transitioned to working on my individual project and focused on establishing a strong foundation for both the frontend and backend in my project.

### Reflections to Include:
1. **Completed tasks**
### Frontend:
- **Organized the folder structure:**
   - Created `src/components/` for reusable components.
   - Created `src/pages/` for application pages.
   - Created `src/styles/` for global and SCSS styles.
   - **Installed essential frontend packages** such as `react-bootstrap`, `fontawesome`, and other dependencies for UI components and styling.
   - **Updated SCSS styles** to provide a consistent and responsive design.

### Backend:
- **Set up the backend environment:**
  - Installed necessary packages like `express`, `dotenv`, and `typescript`.
  - Created the initial folder structure and starter files.
  - Added a `.env` file for managing environment variables.
  - Configured `tsconfig.json` to meet project requirements.
  - Verified the backend setup by generating the `dist` folder.

### Reusable Components:
- Drafted descriptions for **global components** (e.g., Navbar, Footer, Button).
- Started building **reusable components** that will be used across multiple pages, with plans to finalize them next week.

2. **Challenges**
   - **Balancing the setup** for both frontend and backend environments simultaneously.
   - **Designing reusable components** with flexibility while ensuring maintainability.

3. **Learning insights**
   - Improved **folder structure organization** for scalability in React projects.
   - Enhanced understanding of managing `.env` files and configuring a **TypeScript environment** for backend development.

4. **Personal contributions**
   - **Established folder structures** and installed essential dependencies for both frontend and backend environments.
   - **Designed and described reusable components** for consistent UI development.
   - Configured backend setup, verified `tsconfig.json`, and generated the compiled `dist` folder.
   - Updated **SCSS styles**, laying the foundation for responsive and maintainable design.
