# Week 1: Reflections
- **Week Range:** 02.12.24 - 08.12.24
- **Note:** I initially started working with my previous group and completed several tasks related to the FoodFinder App. However, due to challenges related to group dynamics, I made the decision to transition to an individual project in the following weeks to ensure steady progress and deliver a fully functional project within the limited time frame.

### Reflections to Include:
1. **Completed tasks**
   - Created initial project setup with necessary packages and folder structure,
   - Created possible pages and components which can be used in these pages,
   - Created README files including setup instructions

2. **Challenges**
   - **Group Dynamics:** The primary challenge during the week was related to group collaboration. Despite an initial plan and task allocation, there were inconsistencies in communication and contributions, which hindered progress.

3. **Learning insights**
   - Improved my skills about deciding which components can be included in the project and which packages and features should be considered in regard to project.

4. **Personal contributions**
   - Led the creation of the initial project setup and folder structure.
